## Project Overview
This project provides a robust framework for UI testing using Selenium WebDriver. It is built to be maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend for various web applications. The framework includes utilities for common Selenium operations, environment configuration, and detailed test reporting.

## Features
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Structured design for better maintainability.
- **WebDriver Management**: Automated browser driver setup using WebDriverManager.
- **Configuration Management**: Supports multiple browsers and environments via properties file.
- **Utility Classes**: Helpers for waits, clicks, screenshot capture, and element highlighting.
- **Test Structure**: Base test class with setup/teardown and sample login tests.
- **Reporting**: HTML reports with ExtentReports, including screenshots on test failure.

## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) installed
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) recommended
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd selenium-ui-testing
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to download all Maven dependencies:
bash

Copy
mvn clean install
Configure the Properties File:
Open src/main/resources/config.properties.
Update the browser (browser=chrome or browser=firefox) and other settings as needed.
Set Up WebDriver:
The project uses WebDriverManager to automatically manage browser drivers. No manual driver setup is required.
Running Tests
To execute the tests, use the following Maven command:

bash

Copy
mvn test
Tests are located in src/test/java/tests/.
Sample login tests are provided as examples.
You can also run specific tests via your IDE by navigating to the test class (e.g., LoginTests) and executing the desired test method.

Configuration
The config.properties file (src/main/resources/) allows you to customize the test environment:

browser: Set to chrome, firefox, etc.
url: Target application URL for testing.
Other properties can be added as needed (e.g., timeouts, credentials).
